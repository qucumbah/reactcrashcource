all the info is stored in session cookies
on login write additional cookie: loggedIn=true (cosmetic change, doesn't affect security)
when loading the app, we'll check this additional cookie;
if loggedIn=false:
	render login and signin buttons
	load data from localStorage if there is any
if loggedIn=true:
	app.state.isLoading=true
	render logout button
	fetch user info from get /userInfo (uses session cookie, returns error if the user is not logged in/wrong cookie)
	render loader instead of words
	when fetch is done remove loader and render words

concerns:
without registration it has to use localStorage, so it will use two different ways to alter user info => ?
on each change app will have to send entire user data to server => need to refactor app state changes:
	better sets array (right now it uses set id, which is unoptimal; use set's pos in the array. This way we wont have to search for the set each time we change/add words. Leave setid for react rendering)
